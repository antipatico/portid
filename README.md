# portid
Static service identification based on port number.

This scripts leverages [IANA's Service Name and Transport Protocol Port Number
Registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
to statically identify services using **just** the port number.

Thanks to [silverwind](https://github.com/silverwind/) for maintaining an
updated json of the ports provided by IANA.
